trying to create jest test case for a function that throws an error requires a the `expect` argument to
be a function (e.g. arrow function). see https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tothrowerror

### types and indexing an object
i'm not really sure about the solution... see my stackoverflow 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67895735/best-way-to-update-a-subset-of-object-a-with-values-from-object-b-same-type

it works and it is a good way to do it but i'm not sure why the Pick technique does not work --
actually i know why it doesn't work I just don't know yet if that TS should /could work that way. 
In other words, I don't see the weakness in my hypothesis -- why could it not be:
- how typescript works
- a good, preferred even, way
